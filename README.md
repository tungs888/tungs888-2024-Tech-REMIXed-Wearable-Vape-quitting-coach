Vaping among teenagers is a growing public health concern. 2021 data suggests that around 4.5% of US adults aged 18 and over use electronic cigarettes regularly, with vape usage rising to 11% concentrate among aged 18 – 24. 30% of high school students and over 10% of middle schoolers vape on a frequent basis

Vape quitting coach combining wearable vape detection, AI and in person roll playing game while overcome addiction and temptation in a painful hero's journey, with gamified incentives. The project leverages Bosch air quality sensors for real-time detection, tracking and rewards to empower teens on their journey to becoming vape-free.  

Vape detector and recorder is a part of a larger strategy.

It opening a Conversation: A detector triggering can prompt an open and honest conversation between a parent/caregiver and the teen about the dangers of vaping and the desire to help them quit.
Promoting Support: Detectors can remove the burden from teens to tell on friends or classmates who vape. This can make them more open to seeking help themselves.
Combined with Support Systems: The best approach is to use detectors alongside support systems like counseling, resources to quit vaping, and positive reinforcement for not vaping.

Partners

This project will seeking a collaborative effort between three entities:

UVanguard Consulting: will provide expertise in teen health and addiction recovery with Bosch Sensortech together design the Vape quitting coach hardware.
Electronics Art (EA): EA will donate in-game currency or virtual goods within their popular games as rewards for teens achieving milestones in their quitting journey.
Microsoft: Microsoft will contribute by donating access to their Xbox Game Pass or similar services, creating another rewarding incentive for sustained progress and cloud server for data analysis.

Project Description

Wearable Vape Detectors: Teens committed to quitting vaping will be provided with wearable vape detector. These detector will monitor their vaping activity and transmit data to a privacy protected server. The wearable sensor with location data can calibrate with in room sensor if installed.

Mobile App: A user-friendly mobile app will be developed to display the collected vaping record. The app will track progress over time, visualize milestones achieved, and connect teens to a supportive online community.

Gamification and Rewards: The app will incorporate gamification elements. Teens will earn points for not vaping, reaching milestones (e.g., going a day or a week vape-free), and completing educational modules about the dangers of vaping. Points can be redeemed for in-game rewards donated by EA and access to Xbox Game Pass or similar services donated by Microsoft.

Benefits

Real-time Data Tracking: Provides immediate feedback on vaping activity, allowing teens to see their progress and identify areas for improvement.
Increased Motivation: Gamification elements and rewards incentivize continued progress and celebrate achievements.
Positive Reinforcement: Earning rewards from well-known gaming companies adds a layer of excitement and reinforces positive behavior.
Supportive Community: The mobile app can foster a supportive online community where teens can connect with peers facing similar challenges.

Evaluation

The project's effectiveness will be evaluated through:

Reduction in Vape Use: Track the decrease in vaping instances reported by the wearable detectors.
App Engagement: Monitor user engagement with the mobile app's features and functionalities.
Teen Feedback: Conduct surveys and focus groups to gather feedback from teens on the program's impact and their experience.
Conclusion

This project offers a promising approach to support teens in quitting vaping. By combining real-time data tracking with engaging gamification and attractive rewards, we can empower teens to make healthier choices and achieve a vape-free future. The collaboration between our organization, EA, and Microsoft demonstrates a commitment to leveraging technology for positive social change.

conceptual design for a wearable vape detector tag that's half a square inch:

Shape and Material:

Base: A square stainless steel base measuring half an inch by half an inch (12.7mm x 12.7mm). The stainless steel provides a sleek and durable feel.
Top: Full color e-ink display illuminating Personal hero's encouraging word, companionship alone Hero's Jouney while overcoming abyss of addiction pain

The Hero's Journey Role playing game for addiction quitting social support group story to be developed:

The Herald
The Hero
The Mentor
The Ally
The Guardian

Functionality:

A small, near-invisible sensor sits discreetly within the base, detecting the presence of vape aerosols.
The tag can be worn in multiple ways:
Clipped onto a shirt collar or pocket with a small, secure clip.
Attached to a watch band using a flexible loop.
Worn as a pendant on a necklace or bracelet (if a loop attachment point is included on the side).
If visual appeal of a wearable vape detector tag not popular among teens , the final product could be further refined based on user feedback and technical feasibility.  The Vape senor can shrink to a dongle plug in cell phone, or a pen with BLE bluetooth (which help overcome habit of holding electronic cigarate in hand)

The design aims to be discreet yet stylish. The small size ensures it can be worn comfortably without being too noticeable. The material choices and optional design elements create a modern and sophisticated look that complements most styles.

Additional Considerations:

Battery life: The tag should have a long-lasting battery that can be easily replaced.
Data connectivity: The tag connect to a smartphone app via Bluetooth to track vaping activity and offer support resources. However, this would requir privacy security.

Tracking Progress and Identifying Triggers:

Monitoring Nicotine Exposure: The sensor can track the amount of nicotine a teen is exposed to throughout the day. This data can help them see their progress over time and identify situations or activities that trigger cravings.
Awareness and Accountability: Having real-time data on nicotine exposure can create awareness of vaping habits and hold them accountable for their quitting goals.
Supporting Behavior Change:

Positive Reinforcement: By tracking progress with the sensor, teens can celebrate milestones and nicotine-free days. This positive reinforcement can encourage them to stay on track.
Goal Setting and Adjustment: Seeing the data can help teens and their caregivers set realistic goals and adjust strategies if needed.
Additional Benefits:

Honest Conversations: The sensor data can open up honest conversations with parents or caregivers about cravings, challenges, and successes during the quitting process.
Empowerment: Using a sensor can empower teens to take control of their own quitting journey.
Here's what to keep in mind:

Sensor is a Tool, not a Solution: The sensor itself won't stop the addiction. It should be used alongside other quitting methods like counseling, support groups, and positive reinforcement techniques.
Privacy Concerns: Data privacy related to nicotine exposure needs to be addressed with any wearable sensor solution.
Overall, wearable nicotine quitting sensors hold promise as a tool to help teens quit vaping by providing data-driven insights and supporting behavior change.
